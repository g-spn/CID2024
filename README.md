The purpose of this git repo is to show the progression of my enrollment in Stanford's Code in Place 2024. 

I have previous coding experience from enrolling in CS classes during my undergrad. I am out of touch with coding in general, so I decided to partake in this opportunity to improve my skills in Python. 

These are my goals for enrolling: 
1) Improving the readability codes through my comments. 
2) Understanding of how to develop large projects

This course is the first half of Stanford University's flagship Intro to Python course, CS106A. Their goal is to provide a place for passionate teachers and students to teach or learn Python, respectively. If you wish to be a teacher or a student, please visit https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/. It started in 2020 and has been held almost every summer since then.
